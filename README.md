# Tries
In the attached file, I visually show how to build a ternary search tree and an r-way trie using the phrases "no is th ti fo al go pe to co to th ai of th pa" and "now is the time for all good people to come to the aid of". TSTs and R-way tries are data structures used frequently in string algorithms such as autocompletion and substring searching.
